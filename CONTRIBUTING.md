# Contributing

Thank you for taking the time to contribute to this project. The maintainers
greatly appreciate the interest of contributors and rely on continued engagement
with the community to ensure that this project remains useful. We would like to
take steps to put contributors in the best possible position to have their
contributions accepted. Please take a few moments to read this short guide on
how to contribute; bear in mind that contributions regarding how to best
contribute are also welcome.

## Feedback and Questions

If you wish to discuss anything related to the project, please open a
[GitHub issue](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink/issues/new).

## Contribution Process

Before proposing a contribution via pull request (PR), ideally there is an open
issue describing the need for your contribution (refer to this issue number when
you submit the pull request). We have a 3 steps process for contributions.

1. Fork the project if you have not, and commit changes to a git branch
1. Create a GitHub Pull Request for your change, following the instructions in
   the pull request template.
1. Perform a [Code Review](#code-review-process) with the maintainers on the
   pull request.

### Sign Your Commits

[Instructions](https://contribute.cncf.io/maintainers/github/templates/required/contributing/#sign-your-commits)

### DCO

Licensing is important to open source projects. It provides some assurances that
the software will continue to be available based under the terms that the
author(s) desired. We require that contributors sign off on commits submitted to
our project's repositories. The
[Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)](https://probot.github.io/apps/dco/) is a
way to certify that you wrote and have the right to contribute the code you are
submitting to the project.

You sign-off by adding the following to your commit messages. Your sign-off must
match the git user and email associated with the commit.

    This is my commit message

    Signed-off-by: Your Name <your.name@example.com>

Git has a `-s` command line option to do this automatically:

    git commit -s -m 'This is my commit message'

If you forgot to do this and have not yet pushed your changes to the remote
repository, you can amend your commit with the sign-off by running

    git commit --amend -s

### Pull Request Requirements

1. **Explain your contribution in plain language.** To assist the maintainers in
   understanding and appreciating your pull request, please use the template to
   explain _why_ you are making this contribution, rather than just _what_ the
   contribution entails.
2. **Run E2E tests with success**. You can follow the steps described
   [here](https://interlink-hq.github.io/interLink/docs/Developers)

### Code Review Process

Code review takes place in GitHub pull requests. See
[this article](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests)
if you're not familiar with GitHub Pull Requests.

Once you open a pull request, maintainers will review your code using the
built-in code review process in GitHub PRs. The process at this point is as
follows:

1. A maintainer will review your code and merge it if no changes are necessary.
   Your change will be merged into the repository's `main` branch.
2. If a maintainer has feedback or questions on your changes then they will set
   `request changes` in the review and provide an explanation.

## Using git

For collaboration purposes, it is best if you create a GitHub account and fork
the repository to your own account. Once you do this you will be able to push
your changes to your GitHub repository for others to see and use, and it will be
easier to send pull requests.

### Branches and Commits

You should submit your patch as a git branch named after the GitHub issue, such
as `#3`\. This is called a _topic branch_ and allows users to associate a branch
of code with the issue.

It is a best practice to have your commit message have a _summary line_ that
includes the issue number, followed by an empty line and then a brief
description of the commit. This also helps other contributors understand the
purpose of changes to the code.

```text
    #3 - platform_family and style

    * use platform_family for platform checking
    * update notifies syntax to "resource_type[resource_name]" instead of
      resources() lookup
    * GH-692 - delete config files dropped off by packages in conf.d
    * dropped debian 4 support because all other platforms have the same
      values, and it is older than "old stable" debian release
```

**N.B.** please always check for you commits to be
[signed](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits)

## Release cycle

Main branch is always available. Tagged versions may be created as needed
following [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/) as far as applicable.
