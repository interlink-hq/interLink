## :information_source: Overview

InterLink aims to provide an abstraction for the execution of a Kubernetes pod on any remote resource capable of managing a Container execution lifecycle.

__Goals__:
- TBD

__Non-goals__:
- TBD

The project consists of two main components:

- __A Kubernetes Virtual Node:__ based on the [VirtualKubelet](https://virtual-kubelet.io/) technology. Translating request for a kubernetes pod execution into a remote call to the interLink API server.
- __The interLink API server:__ a modular and pluggable REST server where you can create your own Container manager plugin (called sidecars), or use the existing ones: remote docker execution on a remote host, singularity Container on a remote SLURM batch system.

The project is reusing and get inspired by the [KNoC](https://github.com/CARV-ICS-FORTH/knoc) boilerplates at different levels, implementing the generic API layer in place of an ssh execution as the original contribution.

## :fast_forward: Quick Start

### Virtual node setup

#### :grey_exclamation:  Requirements

- A working Kubernetes instance >1.24
  - if you are in a hurry:
    - `curl -sfL https://get.k3s.io |  INSTALL_K3S_VERSION=v1.25.11+k3s1 INSTALL_K3S_EXEC="--tls-san X.X.X.X" sh -s - --disable traefik --disable metric-server`
      - you do need `--tls-san X.X.X.X` only in case of a machine with a Floating IP attached 
      - `k3s kubect get node` to check whenever the cluster is ready
- Kubectl
- Docker 

#### Bring up the virtual node

Fastest way to start using interlink, is by deploying a VK in Kubernetes using the prebuilt image:

```bash
kubectl create ns vk
kubectl apply -n vk -k ./kustomizations
```

In `./kustomizations` you can then play with the different configuration and deployment files in order to customize your setup, as described [here](#wrench-kustomizing-your-virtual-kubelet) .

### Setup a Dummy remote executer

- Use Docker Compose to create and start up containers:
    ```bash
    docker compose -f docker-compose.yaml up -d
    ```
- You are now running:
    - A Virtual Kubelet
    - The InterLink service
    - A Docker Sidecar
- Submit a YAML to your K8S cluster to test it. You could try:
    ```bash
    kubectl apply -f examples/busyecho_k8s.yaml -n vk
    ```
You will see now a Container starting up on your host, but managed by the docker compose interlink daemons.

### :wrench: Kustomizing your Virtual Kubelet

To customize your virtual node deployment edit the configuration files within the kustomizations directory:
- `kustomization.yaml`: here you can specify resource files and generate configMaps
- `deployment.yaml`: that's the main file you want to edit. Nested into spec -> template -> spec -> containers you can find these fields:
    - name: the Container name
    - image: Here you can specify which image to use, if you need another one. 
    - args: These are the arguments passed to the VK binary running inside the Container.
    - env: Environment Variables used by kubelet and by the VK itself. Check the ENVS list for a detailed explanation on how to set them.
- `vk-cfg.json`: it's the config file for the VK itself. Here you can specify how many resources to allocate for the VK. Note that the name specified here for the VK must match the name given in the others config files.
- `InterLinkConfig.yaml`: configuration file for the inbound/outbound communication (and not only) to/from the InterLink module. For a detailed explanation of all fields, check the [InterLink Config File](#information_source-interlink-config-file) section.
If you perform any change to the listed files, you will have to
```bash
kubectl apply -n vk -k ./kustomizations
```
You can also use Environment Variables to overwrite the majority of default values and even the ones configured in the InterLink Config file. Check the [Environment Variables list](#information_source-environment-variables-list) for a detailed explanation.

## Digging in the project

As previous described, the whole project is split across 3 major components:
- A Virtual Kubelet
- The InterLink API
- Sidecars  
But what actually happens inside every component?

### Virtual Kubelet
The Virtual Kubelet is of course based on the latest Virtual Kubelet release, provided by Kubernetes itself. Being actually a Kubelet, every Pod submitted to the cluster is then registered to the Kubelet if taints and selectors actually match.  
The first thing done by the Virtual Kubelet is attempting a communication with the InterLink API to send a ServiceAccount configuration, which will then be used by the InterLink API to retrieve from the cluster everything is needed by Sidecars; this ServiceAccount has restricted permissions and can ONLY READ and retrieve informations from the registered Pods: no edit/creation/deletion is allowed. The configuration is then stored in a temporary file and sent in the HTTP request body. If some error(s) occurs in this phase, the Virtual Kubelet aborts its execution, since the configuration is crucial to InterLink's proper working. Every 10 seconds, a Ping call is sent to InterLink, to check if the connection is still available; if it is not available for some time, when it will be restored, a new Service Account is generated and sent again.
After that, the VK starts its actual work by managing any basic Pod operation, like adding, removing, quering, etc Pods to/from the cluster.  
While a Pod is being registered, upon a `kubectl apply -f yaml_file.yaml` command for example, the Kubelet sends a Create HTTP call to the InterLink API.  
If at least 1 Pod is registered to the Kubelet, every 5 seconds, a Status HTTP call to the InterLink API is automatically issued to check every Pod's health. If a job executed by a Pod is terminated (returning errors or not) or if a service supposed to run is not running anymore, the Pod is being removed from the Kubernetes Cluster by the Kubelet itself.  
Another way to remove a running Pod is by manually executing a `kubectl delete pod pod_name` command from the CLI. This triggers the sending of a Delete HTTP call to the InterLink API and the deletion of the Pod from the Kubernetes cluster.  
Every HTTP call is performed as a REST standard call, specifing the interlink path, the interlink port and a fixed path, according to the call; for example  `http://localhost:3000/create` is a create call on a InterLink being run on the same VK machine on the port 3000. InterLink path and port can be specified in the InterLinkConfig.yaml file. The body of every call is the same: a marshalled (JSON type) list of Pod descriptors, which are stored in variables of type v1.Pod, a built-in go-client standard Kubernetes type.  

A quick recap to the list of outgoing HTTP calls:
| Call          |              Outgoing URL               |
|---------------|:---------------------------------------:|
| PingInterLink |      InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/ping    |
| SetKubeConfig |   InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/setKubeCFG |
| Create        |    InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/create    |
| Delete        |    InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/delete    |
| Status        |    InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/status    |

### InterLink
InterLink is the middleware in charge to translate Virtual Kubelet's HTTP calls in a standard, agnostic outputs understandable to whatever plugin, called in this context Sidecar, below him. To properly work, a working Kubeconfig must be provided by the Virtual Kubelet.  
Upon the receiving of a call, InterLink usually forwards that call to the sidecar (at least for now), handling any received error, except for the Create call and the SetKubeConfig call, so let's dig it in a bit:
- Ping call:
A very simple call which allow the VK to understand if the InterLink API is online and ready to get a Service Account. The only thing done here is answering the caller with a 200 code.

- SetKubeConfig call:  
This is the call sent by the Virtual Kubelet after te VK has received a GetCFG call; VK performs some operations in its local machine, in order to retrieve a ServiceAccount. After receiving the configuration over the HTTP request body, it is stored inside DataRootFolder/.kube/config and then the environment variable KUBECONFIG is set to that path, to allow InterLink to access the right Kubernetes cluster. From now, InterLink will look at the same K8S cluster used by the Virtual Kubelet. If any error(s) occur, InterLink panics (since it cannot operate without a working kubeconfig) and the error is forwarded to the VK.  

- Create call:  
That's the most complex call, for the moment. Everytime a Pod is registered to the Kubernetes cluster, the VK sends a Create Call to InterLink. In this phase, InterLink can retrieve all ConfigMaps, Secrets and EmpyDirs data (if the ExportPodData is set to true in the InterLinkConfig.yaml file); retrieving data means scanning every Container in every single submitted Pod, looking for Secrets, ConfigMaps and, eventually, EmptyDirs. Once they have been found, the cluster is again queried, using those names, to retrieve their values. All of these values are then assembled together is a single struct of type RetrievedPodData; this struct contains the standard v1.Pod (defined by Kubernetes go-client standard library) and an array of custom sub-struct containing a Container name and every Secret/ConfigMap/EmptyDir related to that specific Container. The parent struct is then marshalled into a JSON and sent over the HTTP request body to the Sidecar.  

- Status/Delete call:  
The received body is just forwarded to the Sidecar and any error is then handled and forwarded to the VK.

A quick recap to the list of HTTP calls:

| Call          |             Incoming URL              |          Outgoing URL         |
|---------------| :-----------------------------------: |:-----------------------------:|
| Ping          |    InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/ping    |                               |
| SetKubeConfig | InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/setKubeCFG |                               |
| Create        |   InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/create   | SidecarURL:SidecarPort/create |
| Delete        |   InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/delete   | SidecarURL:SidecarPort/delete |
| Status        |   InterLinkUrl:InterLinkPort/status   | SidecarURL:SidecarPort/status |

### Sidecars
Sidecars are modular plugins able to talk to InterLink API and, so, to the Kubernetes cluster. They performs specific operations based on what the actual plugin is, but the idea behind them is to submit a Pod on the cluster and, according to annotations, mountpoints, secrets, etc, deploy specific services.
Let's take the Docker Sidecar from the quick start tutorial for example. Submitting a Pod to the cluster means the Sidecar will receive from InterLink the list of all related Secrets, ConfigMaps, EmptyDirs and the description of the Pod itself. Using these informations, the Docker plugin will be able to run a specific Container in the Docker environment, managing volume mounts and choosing the appropriate image for the Container; the Slurm Sidecar will instead generate a script to be run in the Slurm HPC environment: starting from the same Pod, we will have different behaviours according to the running Sidecar, but requests and aknlowdgements from/to the InterLink API will be standard. Each Sidecar accepts the three standard outgoing calls we described in the InterLink API.

#### Docker Sidecar
Despite the InterLink API, there is no outgoing call here, since it's the final endpoint of the chain (like every Sidecar). Let's see every operation performed upon the receving of each call:  
- Create call:  
The received JSON is unmarshaled into an array of RetrievedPodData (described in the types.go of the common package). At this point, iterating over the array allows us to run a `docker run *arguments*` command for each received Container, handling mountpoints for Secrets, ConfigMaps and EmptyDirs, if the appropriate flag is set in the config file.  
The majority of the function aims to define a string to automatically replace the `*arguments*` in the previous statement.
Handling mountpoints actually means creating files and directories reflecting Secrets/ConfigMaps structures; for example, a ConfigMap named "myconfigmap" and having a key named "key1" of value "value1" will generate directories, within a parent directory having the PodID denomination, in the form of ConfigMaps/myconfigmap with a file called "key1" containing the string "value1". Same applies to Secrets and EmptyDirs. Later, using a bind mount, these files will be proper mounted in the Container.  
After mountpoints, commands and relative arguments are also appended to the docker run string.  
Finally, the docker run command is executed and the Container is started.  
If an error occurs, the procedure is aborted and the error is returned to the InterLink API, which will return an error to the VK.  
- Delete call:
The received JSON is unmarshaled into an array of v1.Pod. Iterating over the array, the Sidecar runs a `docker stop *containerName*`, followed by a `docker rm *containername*`. using rm -f is avoided to allow a proper termination of the Container, catching any error.  
If an error occurs, the procedure is aborted and the error is returned to the InterLink API, which will return an error to the VK.  
- Status call:
The received JSON is unmarshaled into an array of v1.Pod. Iterating over the array, the Sidecar runs a `docker ps -aqf name=*containerName*`; if nothing is returned, it means the provided Container is not running or is not existing at all. A code is then return, specifying the status of each Container.
If an error occurs, the procedure is aborted and the error is returned to the InterLink API, which will return an error to the VK.

#### Slurm Sidecar
As Docker Sidecar, there is no outgoing call, being the final endpoint too. About the calls:
- Create call:
The received JSON is unmarshaled into an array of RetrievedPodData (described in the types.go of the common package). A Sbatch script for every Container in each Pod is then created, according to the following:
    - Environment Variables are retrieved from the substruct of type v1.Container and appended to a string using the prefix `--env`
    - Mountpoints are handled in a similar way to Docker Sidecar, but specifying a different parameter name to be appended; also, differently to Docker, which can only share the same filesystem of the host machine, Slurm Sidecar stores by default ConfigMaps/Secrets/EmptyDirs values in ENVS later exported by the Sbatch script itself. At runtime, the script creates the related files, copies the ENVS content inside and finally mounts them, as Docker would. This happens because the Worker Node is usually not the same machine as the one used to submit the job and it is not possible to ensure the filesystem to be the same. Since this is a relatively complex operation, error handling is needed and if it errors out, the operation is aborted.
    - ENVS, Mountpoints, Container image, Commands to be executed at runtime and their related arguments are then chained together into a single string and this string is then passed to a function in charge of generating the actual file containing the script.
    - If Tsocks is set to true in the InterLinkConfig file, a TSOCK proxy configuration is added to the script, allowing communication outside the Worker Node
    - The content is finally written to a file called `*containerName*`
  After the script is being generated without errors, it is executed using `sbatch *pathToSriptFile*` and the job ID is saved to a file to eventually abort it later. At this point, SLURM will take care of the job itself.
  If an error occurs, the procedure is aborted and the error is returned to the InterLink API, which will return an error to the VK.
- Delete call:
The received JSON is unmarshaled into an array of v1.Pod. For each Container in each Pod, `scancel *jobID*` is executed and all related files are deleted.
If an error occurs, the procedure is aborted and the error is returned to the InterLink API, which will return an error to the VK.
- Status call:
The received JSON is unmarshaled into an array of v1.Pod. For each Container in each Pod, `squeue --me | grep *jobID*` is executed and if the output is not nil, the return value for the checked Container is set to running, otherwise to not running.
If an error occurs, the procedure is aborted and the error is returned to the InterLink API, which will return an error to the VK.
