## Install interLink

### Deploy Remote components

In general, starting from the deployment of the remote components is adviced. Since the kubernetes virtual node won't reach the `Ready` status until all the stack is successfully deployed.

#### Interlink API server

#### Plugin service

#### Test interLink stack health

interLink comes with a call that can be used to monitor the overall status of both interlink server and plugins, at once.

```
curl -v --unix-socket ${HOME}/.interlink.sock  http://unix/pinglink
```

This call will return the status of the system and its readiness to submit jobs.


### Deploy Kubernetes components

The deployment of the Kubernetes components are managed by the official [HELM chart](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-helm-chart). Depending on the scenario you selected, there might be additional operations to be done.

- Create an helm values file:

```yaml title="values.yaml"
nodeName: interlink-with-socket

plugin:
  enabled: true
  image: "plugin docker image here"
  command: ["/bin/bash", "-c"]
  args: ["/app/plugin"]
  config: |
    your plugin
    configuration
    goes here!!!
  socket: unix:///var/run/plugin.sock

interlink:
  enabled: true
  socket: unix:///var/run/interlink.sock
```

Eventually deploy the latest release of the official [helm chart](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-helm-chart):

```bash
helm upgrade --install --create-namespace \
      -n interlink my-virtual-node oci://ghcr.io/intertwin-eu/interlink-helm-chart/interlink \
      --values ./values.yaml
```

You can fix the [version of the chart](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-helm-chart/blob/main/interlink/Chart.yaml#L18) 
by using the `--version` option. 

Whenever you see the node ready, you are good to go!

To start debugging in case of problems we suggest starting from the pod containers logs!

## Test the setup

Please find a demo pod to test your setup [here](./guides/develop-a-plugin#lets-test-is-out).
