## Install interLink

### Deploy Remote components

In general, starting from the deployment of the remote components is adviced.
Since the kubernetes virtual node won't reach the `Ready` status until all the
stack is successfully deployed.

#### Interlink API server

#### Plugin service

#### Test interLink stack health

interLink comes with a call that can be used to monitor the overall status of
both interlink server and plugins, at once.

```
curl -v --unix-socket ${HOME}/.interlink.sock  http://unix/pinglink
```

This call will return the status of the system and its readiness to submit jobs.

### Deploy Kubernetes components

The deployment of the Kubernetes components are managed by the official
[HELM chart](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-helm-chart). Depending on
the scenario you selected, there might be additional operations to be done.

:::note COMING SOON... :::

Whenever you see the node ready, you are good to go!

To start debugging in case of problems we suggest starting from the pod
containers logs!

## Test and debug

Please find a demo pod to test your setup
[here](../guides/develop-a-plugin#lets-test-is-out).
