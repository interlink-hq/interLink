## Install interLink

### Deploy Remote components

In general, starting from the deployment of the remote components is adviced. 
Since the kubernetes virtual node won't reach the `Ready` 
status until all the stack is successfully deployed.

#### Interlink API server

#### Plugin service

#### Test interLink stack health

interLink comes with a call that can be used to monitor the overall status of 
both interlink server and plugins, at once.

```
curl -v --unix-socket ${HOME}/.interlink.sock  http://unix/pinglink
```

This call will return the status of the system and its readiness to submit jobs.


### Deploy Kubernetes components

The deployment of the Kubernetes components are managed by the official 
[HELM chart](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-helm-chart). 
Depending on the scenario you selected, there might be additional operations 
to be done.

Whenever you see the node ready, you are good to go!

To start debugging in case of problems we suggest starting from the pod containers logs!

## Test and debug

Please find a demo pod to test your setup [here](../guides/develop-a-plugin#lets-test-is-out).
