:::warning

interLink is in early development phase, thus subject to breaking changes with
no guarantee of backward compatibility.

:::

## Overview

interLink enables whoever is running a Kubernetes cluster (named as "local"
here) to offload some of the containers to be executed on other (remote)
systems; e.g. another K8S cluster, an HPC cluster, any other batch systems or
VMs.

Usually the best fit for such an architecture are batch-like (or "job") payloads
-- with a pre-defined lifecycle, non-interactive containers (see
[Targets](#target-applications)). The dispatching to the other (remote) system
is done through a combination of [Virtual Kubelets](https://virtual-kubelet.io/)
interface and [interLink API plugins spec](./guides/03-api-reference.mdx).
Plugins will define how the containers will run on the remote system (see
[Target providers](#providers)).

InterLink API and the plugin can be arranged in three different ways across the
local cluster and the remote part:

- both deployed remote (**[Edge-node](#edge-node)**)
- both deployed local (**[In-cluster](#in-cluster)**)
- API local, plugin remote (**[Tunneled](#tunneled)**)

## Target applications

- **K8s applications with tasks to be executed on HPC systems**: This target
  focuses on Kubernetes applications that require high-performance computing
  (HPC) resources for executing tasks (AI training and inference, ML algorithm
  optimizations etc). These tasks might involve complex computations,
  simulations, or data processing that benefit from the specialized hardware and
  optimized performance of HPC systems.

- **Remote "runner"-like application for heavy payload execution requiring
  GPUs**: This target is designed for applications that need to execute heavy
  computational payloads, particularly those requiring GPU resources. These
  applications can be run remotely, leveraging powerful GPU hardware to handle
  tasks such as machine learning model training, data analysis, or rendering.

- **Lambda-like functions calling on external resources**: This target involves
  running containers on demand with specific computing needs. Now these
  resources might also be outside of the Kubernetes cluster thanks to interLink
  functionality.

## Providers

interLink is designed to ease the work required to include new remote providers.
It already targets a wide range of providers with container execution
capabilities, including but not limited to:

- **SLURM or HTCondor batch systems with Apptainer, Enroot, or Singularity**:
  These batch systems are widely used in high-performance computing environments
  to manage and schedule jobs. By integrating with container runtimes like
  Apptainer, Enroot, or Singularity, our solution can efficiently execute
  containerized tasks on these systems.
- **On-demand virtual machines with any container runtime**: This includes
  virtual machines that can be provisioned on-demand and support container
  runtimes such as Docker, Podman, or others. This flexibility allows for
  scalable and dynamic resource allocation based on workload requirements.
- **Remote Kubernetes clusters**: Our solution can extend the capabilities of
  existing Kubernetes clusters, enabling them to offload workloads to another
  remote cluster. This is particularly useful for distributing workloads across
  multiple clusters for better resource utilization and fault tolerance.
- **Lambda-like services**: These are serverless computing services that execute
  code in response to events and automatically manage the underlying compute
  resources. By targeting these services, our solution can leverage the
  scalability and efficiency of serverless architectures for containerized
  workloads. All of this, while exposing a bare Kubernetes API kind of
  orchestration.

## NOT a target

- **Long-running services**: Our solution is not designed for services that need
  to run continuously for extended periods. It is optimized for tasks that have
  a defined start and end, rather than persistent services exposing
  intra-cluster communication endpoints.
- **Kubernetes Federation**: We do not aim to support Kubernetes Federation,
  which involves managing multiple Kubernetes clusters as a single entity. Our
  focus is on enabling Kubernetes pods to execute on remote resources, not on
  federating all kind of resources on multiple clusters.

## Deployment scenarios

### Edge-node

In this scenario, the Virtual Kubelet communicates with remote services deployed
on a dedicate edge node exposing authenticated interLink APIs and its associated
plugin. This setup is ideal for scenarios where edge computing resources are
utilized for controlled communication b/w the Kubernetes cluster and the remote
resources.

  }}
/>

:::note

Get started with edge-node deployment [here](./cookbook/1-edge.mdx)

:::

### In-cluster

This scenario involves deploying a Virtual Kubelet along with the interLink API
server and the plugin to interact with a remote API. This setup allows
Kubernetes pods to be executed on remote resources while all other components
sits inside the Kubernetes cluster.

    dark: useBaseUrl("/img/scenario-2_dark.svg"),
  }}
/>

:::note

Get started with in-cluster deployment [here](./cookbook/2-incluster.mdx)

:::

### Tunneled

This deployment involves the Virtual Kubelet connecting to a remote interLink
API server and its plugin through a secure tunnel. This setup ensures secure
communication between the Kubernetes cluster and the remote resources, making it
suitable for environments with strict security requirements or to host services
on a multi user host like a login node.
