# Deploy interLink virtual nodes

Learn how to deploy interLink virtual nodes on your cluster. In this tutorial you are going to setup all the needed components to be able to either __develop__ or __deploy__ the plugin for container management on a **remote** host via a **local** kubernetes cluster.

The installation script that we are going to configure will take care of providing you with a complete Kubernetes manifest to instantiate the virtual node interface. Also you will get an installation bash script to be executed on the remote host where you want to delegate your container execution. That script is already configured to **automatically** authenticate the incoming request from the virtual node component, and forward the correct instructions to the openAPI interface of the [interLink plugin](./api-reference) (a.k.a. sidecar) of your choice. Thus you can use this setup also for directly [developing a plugin](./develop-a-plugin), without caring for anything else.

For a complete guide on all the possible scenarios, please refer to the [Cookbook](../cookbook).

## Requirements

- __kubectl host__: an host with MiniKube installed and running
- A GitHub account
- __remote host__: A "remote" machine with a port that is reachable by the MiniKube host


## Create an OAuth GitHub app

:::warning
In this tutorial GitHub tokens are just an example of authentication mechanism, any OpenID compliant identity provider is also supported with the very same deployment script, see [examples here](./oidc-IAM).
:::

As a first step, you need to create a GitHub OAuth application to allow interLink to make authentication between your Kubernetes cluster and the remote endpoint.

Head to [https://github.com/settings/apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) and click on `New GitHub App`. You should now be looking at a form like this:

<ThemedImage 
        alt="Docusaurus themed image"
        sources={{
          light: useBaseUrl('/img/github-app-new.png'),
          dark: useBaseUrl('/img/github-app-new.png'),
        }}
/>

Provide a name for the OAuth2 application, e.g. `interlink-demo-test`, and you can skip the description, unless you want to provide one for future reference. 
For our purpose Homepage reference is also not used, so fill free to put there `https://intertwin-eu.github.io/interLink/`.

Check now that refresh token and device flow authentication:


<ThemedImage 
        alt="Docusaurus themed image"
        sources={{
          light: useBaseUrl('/img/github-app-new2.png'),
          dark: useBaseUrl('/img/github-app-new2.png'),
        }}
/>

Disable webhooks and save clicking on `Create GitHub App`

<ThemedImage 
        alt="Docusaurus themed image"
        sources={{
          light: useBaseUrl('/img/github-app-new3.png'),
          dark: useBaseUrl('/img/github-app-new3.png'),
        }}
/>

You can click then on your application that should now appear at [https://github.com/settings/apps](https://github.com/settings/apps) and you need to save two strings: the `Client ID` and clicking on `Generate a new client secret` you should be able to note down the relative `Client Secret`.  

Now it's all set for the next steps.

## Configuring your virtual kubelet setup (remote host)

Login into the machine and and download the interLink **installer CLI** for your OS and processor architecture from the [release page](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interLink/releases), looking for the binaries starting with `interlink-install`. For instance, if on a `Linux` platform with `x86_64` processor:

```bash
export VERSION=0.2.3-pre6
wget -O interlink-installer https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interLink/releases/download/$VERSION/interlink-installer_Linux_x86_64
chmod +x interlink-installer
```

The CLI offers a utility option to initiate an empty config file for the installation at `$HOME/.interlink.yaml`:

```bash
./interlink-installer --init
```

You are now ready to go ahead and edit the produced file with all the setup information.

Let's take the following as an example of a valid configuration file:

:::warning
see [release page](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interLink/releases) to get the latest one! And change the value accordingly!
:::

```yaml title="$HOME/.interlink.yaml"
interlink_ip: 192.168.1.127
interlink_port: 30443
interlink_version: 0.2.1-patch2
kubelet_node_name: my-civo-node
kubernetes_namespace: interlink
node_limits:
    cpu: "10"
    memory: 256Gi
    pods: "10"
oauth:
    provider: github
    issuer: https://github.com/oauth
    grant_type: authorization_code
    scopes:
      - "read:user"
    github_user: "dciangot"
    token_url: "https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token"
    device_code_url: "https://github.com/login/device/code"
    client_id: "XXXXXXX"
    client_secret: "XXXXXXXX"
```

This config file has the following meaning:
- the remote components (where the pods will be "offloaded") will listen on the ip address `192.168.1.127` on the port `30443`
- deploy all the components from interlink release 0.1.2 (see [release page](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interLink/releases) to get the latest one)
- the virtual node will appear in the cluster under the name `my-civo-node`
- the in-cluster components will run under `interlink` namespace
- the virtual node will show the following static resources availability:
  - 10 cores
  - 256GiB RAM
  - a maximum of 10 pods
- the cluster-to-interlink communication will be authenticated via github provider, with a token with minimum capabilities (scope `read:user` only), and only the tokens for user `dciangot` will be allowed to talk to the interlink APIs
- `token_url` and `device_code_url` should be left like that if you use GitHub
- `cliend_id` and `client_secret` noted down at the beginning of the tutorial

You are ready now to go ahead generating the needed manifests and script for the deployment.


## Deploy the interLink core components (remote host)

Login into the machine and generate the manifests and the automatic interlink installation script with:

```bash
./interlink-installer
```

follow the instruction to authenticate with the device code flow and, if everything went well, you should get an output like the following:

```text
please enter code XXXX-XXXX at https://github.com/login/device


=== Deployment file written at:  /Users/dciangot/.interlink/interlink.yaml ===

 To deploy the virtual kubelet run:
    kubectl apply -f /Users/dciangot/.interlink/interlink.yaml


=== Installation script for remote interLink APIs stored at: /Users/dciangot/.interlink/interlink-remote.sh ===

  Please execute the script on the remote server: 192.168.1.127

  "./interlink-remote.sh install" followed by "interlink-remote.sh start"
```


Start installing all the needed binaries and configurations:

```bash
chmod +x ./interlink-remote.sh
./interlink-remote.sh install
```

:::warning

By default the script will generate self-signed certificates for your ip adrress. If you want to use yours you can place them in `~/.interlink/config/tls.{crt,key}`.

:::

Now it's time to star the components (namely oauth2_proxy and interlink API server):

```bash
./interlink-remote.sh start
```

Check that no errors appear in the logs located in `~/.interlink/logs`. You should also start seeing ping requests coming in from your kubernetes cluster.

To stop or restart the components you can use the dedicated commands:

```bash
./interlink-remote.sh stop
./interlink-remote.sh restart 
```

## Attach your favorite plugin or develop one! (remote host)

[Next chapter](./develop-a-plugin) will show the basics for developing a new plugin following the interLink openAPI spec.

In alterative you can start an already supported one.


### Remote SLURM job submission

:::warning
Note that the SLURM plugin repository is: [github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-slurm-plugin](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-slurm-plugin) 
:::

#### Requirements

- a slurm CLI available on the remote host and configured to interact with the computing cluster
- a sharedFS with all the worker nodes
  - an experimental feature is available for cases in which this is not possible

#### Configuration

Create a config file `$HOME/.interlink/config/slurm.yaml`:

```yaml title="$HOME/.interlink/config/slurm.yaml"
# Plugin local endpoint
SidecarPort: "4000"
SidecarURL: "http://localhost"

# Prefix for every plugin slurm command
CommandPrefix: ""

# Use sharedFS for configmap and secrets
ExportPodData: true

# Directory where all the core interlink logs and jobs will be tracked
DataRootFolder: "/home/civo/.interlink/"

# The endpoint for the slurm plugin daemon
InterlinkURL: "http://localhost"
InterlinkPort: "30080"

# Absolute path to slurm and bash command
SbatchPath: "/usr/bin/sbatch"
ScancelPath: "/usr/bin/scancel"
SqueuePath: "/usr/bin/squeue"
BashPath: "/bin/bash"

# THIS IS FOR TEST PURPOSE!!
HTTP:
  Insecure: true
KubeletHTTP:
  Insecure: true
```

:::danger
Before going ahead, put the correct DataRootFolder in the example above! Don't forget the `/` at the end!
:::

#### Systemd installation

:::warning
To get the latest version of the plugin, please visit the [release](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-slurm-plugin/releases) page.
:::

Download the latest release with:

```bash
VERSION=0.3.1
wget -O $HOME/.interlink/bin/slurm-plugin https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-slurm-plugin/releases/download/$VERSION/interlink-sidecar-slurm_Linux_x86_64
chmod +x $HOME/.interlink/bin/slurm-plugin
```

Now you can create a systemd service on the user space with the following:

```bash
mkdir -p $HOME/.config/systemd/user

cat <<EOF > $HOME/.config/systemd/user/slurm-plugin.service
[Unit]
Description=This Unit is needed to automatically start the SLURM plugin at system startup
After=network.target

[Service]
Type=simple
ExecStart=$HOME/.interlink/bin/slurm-plugin
Environment="SLURMCONFIGPATH=$HOME/.interlink/config/slurm.yaml"
Environment="SHARED_FS=true"
StandardOutput=file:$HOME/.interlink/logs/plugin.log
StandardError=file:$HOME/.interlink/logs/plugin.log

[Install]
WantedBy=multi-user.target
EOF

systemctl --user daemon-reload
systemctl --user enable slurm-plugin.service
```

An eventually starting and monitoring with `start` and `status`:

```
systemctl --user start slurm-plugin.service
systemctl --user status slurm-plugin.service
```

Logs will be stored at `$HOME/.interlink/logs/plugin.log`.

An mantained plugin will come soon...
In the meantime you can take a look at the ["developing a plugin"](./develop-a-plugin) example.
:::

- [Docker plugin repository](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-docker-plugin)

### Submit pods to HTcondor or ARC batch systems

:::warning
Coming soon
:::

- [HTCondor plugin repository](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-htcondor-plugin)
- [ARC plugin repository](https://github.com/interTwin-eu/interlink-arc-plugin)

### Remote Kubernetes Plugin

InterLink plugin to extend the capabilities of existing Kubernetes clusters, enabling them to offload workloads to another remote cluster.
The plugin supports the offloading of PODs that expose HTTP endpoints (i.e., HTTP Microservices).

- [Interlink Kubernetes Plugin](https://baltig.infn.it/mgattari/interlink-kubernetes-plugin)

## Deploy the interlink Kubernetes Agent (kubeclt host)

We are almost there! Essentially you need to follow what suggested by the prompt of the installation script, so copy the generated `interlink.yaml` into you __kubectl host__.

So go ahead and apply the produced manifest to your minikube/kubernetes instance with:

```bash
kubectl apply -f $HOME/.interlink/interlink.yaml
```

Check that the node appears successfully after some time, or as soon as you see the pods in namespace `interlink` running.

You are all setup, congratulations!

## Test your setup

Please find a demo pod to test your setup [here](./develop-a-plugin#lets-test-is-out).
