# Deploy your plugin

## Attach your favorite plugin or develop one! (remote host)

[Next chapter](./develop-a-plugin) will show the basics for developing a new
plugin following the interLink openAPI spec.

In alterative you can start an already supported one.

### Remote SLURM job submission

If you manage a SLURM batch system, and you satisfy the requirements below, you
can offload pod from a kubernetes cluster to your batch system, using interLink
SLURM plugin of course.

- [github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-slurm-plugin](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-slurm-plugin)

#### Requirements

- a SLURM CLI available on the remote host and configured to interact with the
  computing cluster
- a sharedFS with all the worker nodes
  - an experimental feature is available for cases in which this is not possible

#### Configuration

Please refer to either the plugin repository or the
[cookbook](../cookbook/1-edge.mdx) for more information.

### Create UNICORE jobs to run on HPC centers

[UNICORE](https://www.unicore.eu/) (Uniform Interface to Computing Resources)
offers a ready-to-run system including client and server software. UNICORE makes
distributed computing and data resources available in a seamless and secure way
in intranets and the internet.

- [UNICORE plugin](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-unicore-plugin)

#### Configuration

Please refer to either the plugin repository for more information.

### Remote docker execution

You get a VM from you cloud provider, with some GPUs maybe. You can attach it to
your Kubernetes cluster using interLink docker plugin.

- [Docker plugin repository](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-docker-plugin)

#### Configuration

Please refer to either the plugin repository or the
[cookbook](../cookbook/1-edge.mdx) for more information.

### Submit pods to HTcondor or ARC batch systems

- [HTCondor plugin repository](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-htcondor-plugin)
- [ARC plugin repository](https://github.com/interlink-hq/interlink-arc-plugin)

### Remote Kubernetes Plugin

InterLink plugin to extend the capabilities of existing Kubernetes clusters,
enabling them to offload workloads to another remote cluster. The plugin
supports the offloading of PODs that expose HTTP endpoints (i.e., HTTP
Microservices).

- [Interlink Kubernetes Plugin](https://baltig.infn.it/mgattari/interlink-kubernetes-plugin)

#### Configuration

Please refer to either the plugin repository or the
[cookbook](../cookbook/1-edge.mdx) for more information.

## Test your setup

Please find a demo pod to test your setup
[here](./develop-a-plugin#lets-test-is-out).
