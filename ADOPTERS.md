## Scientific communities

### INFN

Project: Heterogeneous Resource integration for scientific workflows/pipelines

Used to enable a seamless provisioning of heterogeneous resources to k8s-based workload manager. interLink grant the possibility to offload the execution of parts of the workload to external providers serving suitable hardware. Leveraging the capability to provision any type of backend without customization on the user end, it makes transparent  the exploitation of HPC centers 

INFN adopts InterLink also in the context of the 
[AI_INFN initiative](https://ai-infn.baltig-pages.infn.it/wp-1/docs/) of the Fifth National 
Scientific Committee, to submit Machine Learning pipelines to HPC and HTC centers. 

### CERN

Project: interTwin

We used interLink to offload the execution of ML/AI workloads to HPC in the context of the interTwin project, including use cases from both pysics (CERN, Virgo) and climate research (CMCC, EURAC) communities. interLink allowed us to test the functionalities of [itwinai](https://itwinai.readthedocs.io/) on HPC by running distributed ML training and inference workloads. Moreover, interLink allows us automatically connect our containers CI/CD pipeline with HPC, enabling the execution of integration tests on HPC from the same CI/CD.

### EGI Foundation

We are integrating interLink in order to provide integration of HPC centers with the EGI Cloud Container compute service. interLink is also included as building block on new EC projects starting in 2025 led by EGI Foundation ( RI-SCALE and EOSC Data Commons)

## HPC supercomputing centers

### CNES

Project: LISA DDPC

In the context of LISA (Laser Interferometer Space Antenna) DDPC (Distributed Data Processing Center), CNES is using Interlink to prototype an hybrid execution of LISA pipelines on either Kubernetes or Slurm resources.
